## Intro

This page contains some ideas for me to write blog posts about. Have something that you'd like to know more about? Let me know! You can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jordy_vD_).

Note: This doesn't mean I'll write about everything in here. They're just ideas.

## To-do

Next.JS does this out of the box. Explain how we can do this with create-react-app and react-router-dom. (loadable-component)

### Using Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit has been out there for a while, yet a surprisingly small amount of people know about it. Explain the differences and how to get started.

### Javascript array methods

A post that explains JavaScript array methods, they're really useful but you have to know when to use which one.

Maybe make it a series with how you install it as well.

### React Hooks

### Next.JS: Setting up a blog with Next.JS

### Javascript: Spread operator

### Flutter: Getting started

### Be a teacher, not a grumpy dev

When I started programming, the developers I looked up to because they were really good, were also really grumpy and often made new developers feel like they should just learn everything on their own. With this post I hope I can explain how and why I decided not to be like them.

### Vercel: Ship it 'n fuhgeddaboutit
